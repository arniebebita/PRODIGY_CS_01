# PRODIGY_CS_01
Prodigy Cyber Security Internship - Task 1 - Implement Caesar Cipher

Create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

Hereâ€™s a simple Python program that uses the Caesar Cipher algorithm for encryption and decryption:

[Please see attached caesar_cipher.py file.]

In this program, the caesar_cipher function performs the encryption or decryption based on the mode parameter. If mode is 1, it encrypts the text; if mode is -1, it decrypts the text. The main function handles user input and output. It asks the user to enter the text, shift value, and mode 
(E for encryption, D for decryption). Then it calls the caesar_cipher function with the appropriate parameters and prints the result. If the user enters an invalid mode, it prints an error message. You can run this program in a Python environment.
